What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

The 6 phases of web design are

(1) Information Gathering

think about what the purpose of the site is (i.e sell a product, promote, etc.). Talk to the client about their needs. Establish what you would like to accomplish by creating the site. Establish the target audience. Decide what kind of content the site will host, what will you target audience be looking for.

(2) Planning

Create a site map. Decide what technologies should be implemented.

(3) Design

determine the look and feel of the site. Create one or more prototypes and wire frames. communicate with the client about the look and feel.

(4) Development

Create the website itself, incorporate elements from the prototype. Add HTML and CSS etc...

(5) Testing and Delivery

Make sure the site works! Check all link, buttons, etc. make sure the site validate and meets current web standards. Deliver site with FTP to server.

(6) Maintenance

updates and improvements. You can provide access to update and improve some aspects to client with a CMS.

My sites primary purpose as of now is to get my name out into the Internet. I am making a site so employers can see my work, and so I can network with other developers, or people with common interests. In the future I hope to create a more informative sight that people can learn some things from or find interest in. I plan on putting up links to projects I've developed and starting a blog, hopefully my target audience (potential employers and collaborators) will find these things interesting.

The primary action I would like visitors to take is to take a look at my portfolio. The portfolio page would link to my Github and other projects I've done. Those links would open in a new window. Then once they know a little bit about the work I have done, they could learn more about me in the about me page, then  go to the contact me page to reach out.

The main thing someone should know about design and UX is that is all about the end user. Who will be using this site or app? How will they use it? will it be easy to use? or better yet, will it be fun or interesting to use? I think it is also important to recognize the cost/benifit for UX. It can sometimes be an expensive and slow process to incorporate UX development, but in a complex system it is absolutely necessary. A business could be taking a big loss in revenue by overlooking the user experience in a complex system.

Honestly the most tedious parts of this challenge were creating the site map and writing this reflection. I have probably spent about 5 hours in total on this challenge. I downloaded Gimp in order to make the site map, and learned how to create some boxes and text and a couple of over things. My site map still doesn't look great. I made some edits to it as well after thinking more about my site. Reflections almost always tedious for me, I obsess about my writing and covering details and burn myself out. I'm sorry to whoever is reviewing this, I'll end it here.
