<!--            REFLECTION
===========================================================
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?


It was fun writing HTML with Paul. I felt like I was
holding back a little bit in order to keep within the time
frame and not make any use of CSS. I have taken a couple
of web design classes in high school and college, so I
already knew most of the material covered in terms of HTML.
 I don't have much experience with HTML5. I don't think we
 used any semantic HTML5 elements, though I do know what
 they are and we took a brief look at them.

I think we did a pretty good job of keeping with the best
practices. We finished right on time and didn't format at
all. Our site looks more or less like the example given in
the challenge.

I think HTML is really good at creating a framework for a
website, but it provides almost no ability to format or
position elements of the page. Its really difficult for me
to deal with that when I know adding CSS isn't that much
 more to do. I think HTML is kind of a tedious language
 because it requires so many brackets and slashes which
 are annoying to type, and it also requires a lot of
 closing tags. Thankfully sublime text and most IDE's
 support auto completion which saves time and headaches.
 HTML validators can help with finding issues such as
 missing tags or brackets.

I don't know that I have any tricks for remembering HTML.
I haven't done a ton of HTML, but I have done enough to
have the basics down. Anything that I can't remember or
don't know, I just google and usually a simple explanation
will pop up from W3schools.
