A wireframe, is a visual rough draft of the website. It should be just the bare bones, and be able to made and changed quickly. A wireframe is not a functional website or a beta. It is just the most basic visual idea of the layout of website. Some argue that wireframes should not even contain any actual pictures or colors, but just a placeholder, explaining what will be there later. Typically during the design phase, a number of wireframes are made and modified before entering the development phase with the selected ones.

Wireframing is an integral part of the web design process. It allows for fast prototyping when done properly. It gives clients something to look at before development begins so they can determine if any changes need to be made to the basic look and feel. I helps to improve usability and UX. It makes the development process easier because you can use the wireframe as a frame to build the site on top of. You know exactly what elements are required and can just insert them in place where necessary because the aesthetics have already been handled.

You can see in my repo that I tried a few different ways of wireframing. The first wireframe I did by hand, because I wanted to get a feel for it on paper and use just my imagination before using any external tools. Turns out, I hated doing it this way, It took a really long and time and even for a wireframe, it does not look very good. I made changes to it and had to erase by hand and rewrite some things, probably 3 or 4 times. I moved things around, added a footer, and some links. Then on top of all that I had to scan it. It took way to long. I don't think doing it by hand is the way for me, though I know some prefer to do it that way. For the blog wireframe I downloaded Balsamiq. I really like it! It was much easier than doing it by hand. I was able to drag and drop everything in place. I could easily edit and move things around. The UI is very simple but thorough. I think my second wireframe is a lot better, and looks nicer too.

I think the main question I had was what wireframe tool should I use and how should my wireframe look. I googled and checkout a few wireframe examples before drawing elements out from the ones that I liked. I also used the list on http://mashable.com/2010/07/15/wireframing-tools/ to find the wiredframing tool I liked.

My main struggle in this challenge was finding a wireframing tool that I liked. I didn't like any of the ones that I tried until Balsamiq. Doing it by hand was bad, I didn't like mockingbird, lovely charts, or gliffy. I finally settled on Balsamiq because it seemed like the most usable and best looking free (at least for 30 days, but I will probably buy it if I don't find something I like better) option.
