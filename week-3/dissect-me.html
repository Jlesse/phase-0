    <h2>--Version Control--</h2>

    <p>When developers work on collaborative projects, it’s a challenge to keep everyone up to date with each other’s edits and saves while maintaining one bug-free and usable version. To manage these issues we use “Version Control” systems.</p>

    <p>Version control could be as simple as a college student classifying an essay as “first draft”, making edits in the margins and revising a “working draft” then polishing it up and submitting a “final draft”. The basic advantages of version control remain:</p>

    <p>1. an accessible history of edits and saves
    </p>

    <p>2. versions that can be reverted to (if new edits don’t work)</p>

    <p>Let’s say now the next assignment is one essay to be worked on by the entire class, with separate groups working on grammar, vocabulary, formatting, and research— That’s sort of like working on a piece of software and it can get complicated.</p>

    <p>To handle these large collaborative projects, developers use systems like git and GitHub to understand the who, when and why of edits as well as keeping a central, up to date version of the project.</p>

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this
challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is
the order the browser uses to display elements?
What did you learn about Sublime in this
challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy
snippets at a later date? What about research some
shortcuts that already exist?

I have been using the article tag a lot recently.
I think that nature of the tag makes a really
common occurrences. Its the second node in the HTML5
 element flow chart, so it its not a major
 navigation block, and it makes sense on its own,
 then an article should be used.

Browsers use rendering engines in order to
receive, parse, and display content in the browser.
Google chrome uses a rendering engine known as
webkit. When a rendering engine receives data from
the network layer, is begins parsing the HTML
document into a parse tree.
It turns the tags in DOM nodes in a content tree.
It parses the CSS and combines this information
with the information contained in the content tree
to create the render. The render tree contains the
 visual elements in the order they will be
 displayed. In webkit terminology these visual
 elements are known as renderers or render objects.
 each renderer represents a rectangle with
 dimensions typically determined by the nodes CSS
 box (see the box model). After the render tree is
 done, the layout process begins. Each node is now
 given position coordinates of where it should
 appear. Then the painting stage begins - the
 render tree is traversed and each node is painted
 to the screen. Typically these process are all
 happening at the same time in order to improve
 load time efficiency. I read a little bit about
 rendering engines from this website, and you may
  get a better explanation from it. here is the
  link http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm

I learned some cool tricks with sublime today. I
really like that snippets exist. They save a ton
of time. I will definitely use and make more in
the future. I saw on-line that people share
snippets which is helpful. Our guide told us about
the cmd-shift-p shortcut, and showed us auto how
to format our indention with it. That is really
helpful. I will definitely look more into
shortcuts in the future. -->
