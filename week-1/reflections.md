#Think About Time Reflection

 read mostly about meditation and the Pomodoro technique. I think there is some overlap with Pomodoro and Time Boxing when it comes to estimating a time frame, setting it aside, and limiting work to that time frame. I have been using a planner since High school in order to pick out dates to get things done, but I have never narrowed it done to hours or even minutes. It has worked okay, but i think perfectionism can get in the way and lead to bad time budgeting and burn out as well as spending too much time on some tasks and rushing others near the deadline. I plan to use time Time Boxing and Pomodoro in conjunction with a planner and google calendar in order to set aside time boxes for studying. Within each time box I will use Pomodoro to increase productivity and reduce burn out. During the rest period I will probably meditate or play guitar. I also plan on using mediation to calm my mind at the end of the day, and practice focus. I have begun using the Headspace app for iPhone. I hope to improve my ability to estimate the number of Pomodoros in order to complete tasks more efficiently, and set aside adequate time boxes.

##The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an interface for users to access the features and services of a operating system. Bash is a Unix shell and features a command line interface. It is the default shell for Linux and Mac OSX. It has a slightly different set of commands than the windows command line. The command line AKA shell AKA  bash is frequently used by programmers in order to harness the real power of a computer with efficiently. It is not bogged down by all of the typical slowdowns of a GUI (graphical user interface), like clicking and dragging. It provides a lot of commands and flags to do things like make directories and view folder contents, as well as more complicated things like finding the number of occurrences of a word in a .txt file. I like working with with the shell because it makes me feel like a hacker. Using bash feels kind of like working on the engine of a nice car.

The most challenging part for me going the though the material was typing the commands with accuracy and following the directions precisely. I am still in the process of memorizing the commands, but I have some of the basics I have down. I was able to get though the whole command line crash course slowly but surely. I had a few issues where I mistyped something but I think I got everything to work more or less how it should.

I think its really important to know the file path using pwd. It helps a lot a with moving files around and making sure things are in the proper place. I think the wildcard * is pretty useful to though I haven't done a lot with it. help is important because it helps you incase you forget the command or flag your looking for. I also think pipes provide a lot of power because they can string together some pretty powerful commands if done properly, though again, not something I have yet done a lot of. Obviously the basics are important too, because they help you get around the file structure and make simple changes.

now for the commands:

pwd: prints the working directory

ls: lists the current directories contents

mv: moves a file or folder from one location to another

cd: changes directory

../ : I am not really sure about the ../, but I do know that ".." will take you up one to the directory containing the current one.

less: displays file contents in console one page at a time.

rmdir: removes specified directory

rm: removes specified file

help: gives a list of bash commands and flags as well as current bash version

touch: creates a new file

mkdir: makes a new directory with specified name

###Forking and Cloning Reflection

create a new repo with Github:

You may want to do this when starting a new project or collaborating on a new project. People can now push, pull, fork, etc. from the repo and Github well keep track of changes and preserve versions.

1. go to your profile on github.com
2. hit the plus button in the top right and select New Repository
3. In the new repository page give the repo a name, pick whether you want it to be public or private, choose any files you want ignored with git ignore (if any), pick the license type you wish to use, and then create the repo.

Fork a repo:

A fork will copy a repo to your own Github account. You might want to do this if you want to modify or use the code from the repo.

1. find the repo you would like to fork
2. hit the fork button in the top right, and select your profile to fork to your profile

To clone a repo:

you can clone a Github repo to you local machine with clone command from the terminal. You may want to do this if you want to edit or view a repo on your local machine.

1. copy the HTTPS clone url from the Github repo page.
2. navigate to the folder you would like to clone the repo to in the terminal.
3. use the command "git clone urlname"
4. enter your Github username and password if you haven't already.

======

I didn't really have much difficulty setting up git and github. but I had/still have a lot of difficulty understanding Git, Github, and version control. I think I have somewhat of grasp on the basic idea, but I will need a lot more practice in order to really get it down. I had lot of difficulty with git especially. I felt like I was getting sucked in to the git tutorial and it was taking too much time. I had fun with it, but felt a little confused, and was concerned that I was putting to much attention to just one corner of the whole thing.
