## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create your own repo on Github, 
1. go to your profile 
2. in he top right of the navigation bar click the + button.
3. now your on the the new repository page, enter repo name, choose public or private choose a license type and then hit the create repository button

To clone from Github to your desktop
1.get the http address from the repo page on Github
2.navigate to the folder you would like the clone in using the terminal.
3.type “git clone [http adress from repo]”
4.you may be prompted for your Github username and password if you haven’t already, enter them, and your ready to go!

Open source means that the source code of a software distribution is legally available for viewing and editing. Open source licensing encourages people to share and edit code freely. I like open source, and I frequently use open source software like open office and firefox. I think its a good direction for software to move in, and I think that the trend is to open source things, even Apple and Microsoft are heading this way. If there are many people adding new features, and fixing bugs, over many quick iterations, it can make for some very rich and robust software surrounded by a vibrant community of contributors.

During this challenge I used a cheat sheet that I made from things I had learned in the last challenge, so this one was relatively easier for me. Some things were solidified though. I got some good practice with the basics the git flow: cloning, branching, pushing, pulling, pull request, merging and branch deletion.

I didn’t use any resources outside of what was given, besides the sheet I made.
